## 🎯 API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
- `POST /api/auth/signup` - User registration

### Waste Management

- `POST /api/waste/entries` - Create new waste entry
- `GET /api/waste/entries/:userId?` - Get user's waste entries
- `GET /api/users/:userId` - Get user profile with stats

### Utility

- `GET /api/ping` - Health check
- `GET /api/demo` - Demo endpoint

## 💰 Credit System

### Pricing Structure

- **Paper**: $0.10 per kg
- **Plastic**: $0.15 per kg
- **Metal**: $0.20 per kg
- **Glass, Organic, E-waste, Textile, Hazardous**: No credits (environmental benefit only)

### Credit Calculation

1. User enters waste type and quantity
2. System checks if waste type earns credits
3. Credits = Quantity (kg) × Price per kg
4. Credits are added to user's total balance
5. Transaction is recorded in user's history
